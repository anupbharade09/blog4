description: In this project, we present an approach that uses deep learning techniques for colorizing grayscale images. We have trained a convolutional neural network model, which is designed for image classification, By doing so, we are able to separate content and style of different images and recombine them into a single image. We then propose a method that can add colors to a grayscale image by combining its content with the style of a color image having semantic similarity with the grayscale one.
